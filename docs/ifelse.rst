If-else, the control flow
=========================

While working on real life problems, we have to make decisions. Decisions like which camera to buy or which cricket bat is better. When writing a computer program, we do the same. We make the decisions using if-else statements and we change the flow of control in the program by using them.

If statement
============

The syntax looks like the following

::

    if expression:
        do this

If the value of *expression* is true (anything other than zero), do what is written below under indentation. Please remember to use the proper indentation. All the lines indented will be evaluated depending on the True value of the expression. One simple example is to take some number as input and check if the number is less than 100 or not.

::

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    if number < 100:
        print("The number is less than 100")

Then we run it

::

    $ ./number100.py
    Enter a number: 12
    The number is less than 100

Else statement
==============

Now, in the above example, we want to print "Greater than" if the number is greater than 100. For that, we have to use the *else* statement. This works when the *if* statement is not fulfilled.

::

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    if number < 100:
        print("The number is less than 100")
    else:
        print("The number is greater than 100")

The output

::

    $ ./number100.py
    Enter a number: 345
    The number is greater than 100

Another very basic example

::

    >>> x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
    >>> if x < 0:
    ...      x = 0
    ...      print("Negative changed to zero")
    ... elif x == 0:
    ...      print("Zero")
    ... elif x == 1:
    ...      print("Single")
    ... else:
    ...      print("More")

Truth value testing
===================

The elegant way to test *Truth* values is like

::

    if x:
        pass

.. warning:: Don't do this
    
    ::
    
        if x == True:
            pass
