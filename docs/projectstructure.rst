====================
A project structure
====================

This chapter explains a full Python project structure. What kind of directory
layout you can use and how make release a software to the world.

We will call our example project *factorial*.
::

    $ mkdir pymfactorial
    $ cd pymfactorial/

Primary code
=============

The name of the Python module will be *myfact*, so we will create the directory
next.

::

    $ mkdir myfact

The primary code will be in a file called *fact.py*
::

    "myfact module"

    def factorial(num):
        """
        Returns the factorial value of the given number.

        :arg num: Interger value of whose factorial we will calculate.

        :return: The value of the the factorial or -1 in case negative value passed.
        """
        if num >= 0:
            if num == 0:
                return 1
            return num * factorial(num -1)
        else:
            return -1

We also have a *__init__.py* file for the module.

::

    from fact import factorial
    __all__ = [factorial, ]

We also added a *README.rst* file. So, the directory structure looks like

::

    $ ls
    myfact  README.rst
    $ ls myfact/
    fact.py  __init__.py


MANIFEST.in
============

Now we have to write a *MANIFEST.in* file which will be used to find out which
all files will be part of the source tar ball of the project at the time of
using *sdist* command.

::

    include *.py
    include README.rst

If you want to exclude some file, you can use *exclude* statements in this
file.

LICENSE file
=============

Always remember to add a proper license to your project. You can take help
from `this site <https://choosealicense.com/>`_ if you are new to software
licensing.

The following is the content of our project, which is licensed under **MIT**.

Installing python-setuptools package
====================================

You have to install *python3-setuptools* package in your system. For this we are
using a virtualenv (not showing the steps here). We will also install *wheel*
package.

::

    $ pip install setuptools wheel


setup.py
=========

Finally we have to write a *setup.py* which then can be used to create a source
tarball or installing the software.

::

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    """Factorial project"""
    from setuptools import find_packages, setup

    with open("README.rst", "r") as fobj:
        long_description = fobj.read()

    setup(name = 'pymfactorial',
        version = '0.1',
        description = "pym Factorial module.",
        long_description = long_description,
        platforms = ["Linux"],
        author="Kushal Das",
        author_email="kushaldas@gmail.com",
        url="https://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/",
        license = "MIT",
        packages=find_packages()
    )

**name** is the name of the project, **version** is the release version. You can
easily understand **description** and **long_description**. *platforms* is a
list of the platforms this module can work on. **find_packages** is a special
function which can find all modules under your source directory.

.. note:: To learn more you can read the `packaging docs <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing.html>`_.

You can also add related `classifiers <https://pypi.org/classifiers/>`_ to the setup.py file.

Usage of setup.py
==================

To create a source release and also a binary wheel for distribution, use the following
command.

::

    $ python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
    running sdist
    running egg_info
    creating pymfactorial.egg-info

One can see the output files under *dist* directory.
::

    $ ls dist/
    pymfactorial-0.1-py3-none-any.whl  pymfactorial-0.1.tar.gz

.. warning:: Remember to use a virtualenv while trying to install the code :)


Python Package Index (PyPI)
============================

Do you remember the **pip** command we are using still now? Ever thought from
where those packages are coming from? The answer is `PyPI <http://pypi..org/>`_.
It is a repository of software for the Python programming language.

For our example, we will use the test server of PyPI which is `https://test.pypi.org/ <https://test.pypi.org/>`_

Creating account
-----------------

First register yourself in `this link
<https://test.pypi.org/account/register/>`_. You will receive
an email with a link, go to that link and confirm your registration.


.. note:: Remember to change the name of the project
          to something else in the `setup.py` to test following
          instructions.

Uploading your project
-----------------------

Now finally we can upload our project to the PyPI server using **twine** command.
Remember that this command needs to be invoked immediately after you build the
source/binary distribution files.

First, we will have to install **twine** using **pip** (we are using a virtualenv).

::

    $ pip install twine
    $ twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
    Uploading distributions to https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
    Enter your username: kushaldas
    Enter your password:
    Uploading pymfactorial-0.1-py3-none-any.whl
    100%|██████████████████████████████████████| 4.29k/4.29k [00:01<00:00, 3.77kB/s]
    Uploading pymfactorial-0.1.tar.gz
    100%|██████████████████████████████████████| 3.83k/3.83k [00:00<00:00, 7.57kB/s]

Now if you visit the `site <https://test.pypi.org/pypi/pymfactorial/>`_, you will
find your project is ready to be used by others.

Install from the test PyPI
===========================

You can use the following command to install from the test PyPI.

::

    $ pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pymfactorial
